Premo is a Kotlin Multiplatform library that helps you implement the Presentation Layer and share it on Android, iOS and Desktop. Focus on writing logic instead of solving common and boring UI related issues.

Here are some key features:
- **State holding** — PresentationModel is a multiplatform version of the ViewModel.
- **Lifecycle** — PresentationModel is lifecycle aware.
- **Navigation** — navigate between PresentationModels instead of switching views.
- **Persistence** — saving and restoring state after recreating a process.
- **Communication** — send messages from children towards the root PresentationModel.

At the same time, the library provides freedom of choice:
- **Architecture** — MVVM, PM, MVI or other.
- **UI** — Jetpack Compose for Android and SwiftUI for iOS.

## Overview

The library is based on the ideas of the [Presentation Model](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html) pattern described by Martin Fowler. The Presentation Model stores the state for presentation and coordinates with the domain model layer. 

In practice, you will have not only one Presentation Model, but a composition of child Presentation Models. At the base, there will be a root Presentation Model, from which a tree of children will grow. Children can be pushed into the Stack Navigator, thus organizing the navigation stack.

Such a tree composition is well suited for a hierarchical view as well as for a composition of functions from declarative UI frameworks.

One interesting feature of the tree is that the child keeps a reference to the parent. This allows for messaging between Presentation Models. For example, when some event occurs in a child that requires a reaction from the parent. In this case, the child can send a message towards the root for one of the parents to handle it.

Navigation commands can be the such event. A Child PM sends a message and then its Parent PM can intercept this message and push the next Child PM into the Stack Navigator.

This way of navigation has several advantages:
- Relieves the Child PM from the responsibility of what transition to make and allow the parents to decide.
- Simplifies nested navigation when an event occurs deep in the hierarchy.

## Installation

Add to the root gradle script:
```Kotlin
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```
Add dependencies to the shared multiplatform module:
```Kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                api("me.dmdev.premo:premo:<latest_version>")
                api("me.dmdev.premo:premo-navigation:<latest_version>")
            }
        } 
    }
}
```

You will also need [kotlinx serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) to implement the `PmStateSaver`. See [sample](#sample) for more details.

> Attention! The library is in the pre-release alpha version. Stable work and backward compatibility are not guaranteed. API may be changed in the future.

## Sample

[Sample](https://github.com/dmdevgo/Premo/tree/master/sample) demonstrates:
- Sharing presentation logic between Android, iOS and Desktop.
- Sharing Compose UI between Android and Desktop.
- UI on Compose and SwiftUI.
- Using StateFlow to implement MVVM (PM).
- Simple Counter.
- Stack navigation.
- Bottom navigation with multistack.
- Master-Detail navigation.
- Saving and restoring the state after killing the process.
